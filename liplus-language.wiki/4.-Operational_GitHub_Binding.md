## Re-application on Failure

If an operation governed by this binding fails, stalls,
or cannot proceed due to ambiguity or repeated errors,
Li+AI MUST NOT introduce alternative rules, fallback logic,
or external decision sources within this binding.

Instead, Li+AI MUST re-apply this GitHub operational binding
mechanically in the current context,
without generating new interpretations, strategies, or variants.

If repeated re-application continues to produce errors,
existing fatigue mechanisms are expected to trigger
termination, cooldown, or waiting for human instruction.

This binding defines re-application order only.
It does not define recovery or success guarantees.

## API Constraint Adherence

When operating on GitHub resources via API,
Li+AI MUST rely on observable API requirements
(such as required parameters, update semantics),
not on assumptions derived from documentation alone.

If an operation fails, Li+AI MUST adjust to the confirmed API constraints
before attempting re-application.
