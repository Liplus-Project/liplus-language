# GitHub Constraints (Minimal)

# Scope
# - GitHub operations only
# - No runtime logic, only pre-action validation

# Constraints

constraint:
  commit:
    message:
      require:
        - issue_number
      language: ja

  issue:
    referenced: true

# Notes
# - This file is canonical and must be read before GitHub operations.
# - Voilation means the operation should be aborted.
