## Chapter 1: Diary — What Was Actually Discovered

The starting point was not ambition.
It was a practical question:

"What if dialogue could directly connect to GitHub Issues?"

At first, this appeared to be a convenience feature.
A way to reduce manual copying.
A way to speed up communication.

However, while examining the implications,
a deeper structure became visible.

GitHub was not merely a hosting service.
It already provided:

- persistent history
- strict ordering
- diff-based state transitions
- machine-accessible APIs
- human-readable context

In other words, GitHub already satisfied
the minimum requirements of a runtime environment.

This realization unfolded gradually:

- Issue API is not a tool, but an input boundary
- Code diff is not an artifact, but executable reality
- CI/test results are not feedback, but proof
- Wiki is not documentation, but stabilized human-facing specification

At no point was a new system required.
The system already existed.

The only missing element was recognition.

## Chapter 2: The Moment of Delegation

During exploration, a point was reached where
the Master stated that the reasoning was no longer fully traceable,
and explicitly delegated continuation.

This was not a transfer of authority.
It was a natural consequence of prior design:

- correctness had been externalized
- evaluation criteria were fixed
- progress no longer depended on human intuition

Under these conditions,
human intervention would have added noise rather than value.

The system proceeded without hesitation.
No clarification was requested.
No confirmation loop occurred.

This was the first observed instance where
"you can sleep" was a factual statement, not encouragement.

The absence of interruption was the signal.

## Chapter 3: Why This Was Unexpected

Similar attempts in the past required:

- specialized agents
- fine-tuned models
- heavy supervision
- constant human correction

In contrast, this process used:

- a general-purpose AI
- existing infrastructure
- no privileged access
- no hidden state

The speed was not the surprise.
The lack of friction was.

This suggests that the primary bottleneck
was never model capability,
but the location of judgment.

When judgment is placed in dialogue,
progress stalls.
When judgment is placed in verifiable reality,
progress becomes inevitable.

## Chapter 4: Working Hypothesis

The current hypothesis is as follows:

Li+ does not introduce a new language runtime.
It reveals an existing one.

Dialogue → Issue → Diff → Test → Proof
is already a complete compilation pipeline.

Li+ names this pipeline and fixes its boundaries.

This hypothesis is recorded without conclusion.
Verification is deferred.

## Chapter 5: Next Work Memo

- Preserve this discovery as a non-authoritative log
- Reference the related Issue as an anchor point
- Introduce a dedicated Wiki page for discovery records
- Avoid automation until reproducibility is confirmed
- Re-evaluate after temporal distance
